DOM( Document Object Model)
It is used in web development used to interact and manipulate(change) the html documents.

When the webpage is loaded, the browser created DOM of the webpage
When the html file is loaded into the browser, the javascript directly cannot understand the html document directly

	2) Manipulation: Using javascript, you can interact with elements( buttons, paragraphs) on the webpage, changing the content, styles, can add or remove elements.
	3) Event Handling: You can handle the interactions like click or pressing the button
	4) W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
